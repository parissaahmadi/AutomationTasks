# Automation Tasks
"AutomationTasks" refers to tasks that are performed using Python for automation. Python is a powerful programming language that is very popular for automating various tasks due to its simplicity and simple syntaxÂ¹. Using Python, you can automate repetitive and tedious tasks, including data processing, file management, web shopping, API automation, and more.

In this repository, I tried to share with you the scripts that I use in my daily work and life. I hope it is useful for you. This branch includes the following items, each of which I will briefly explain. If necessary, enter each folder and run the relevant code according to the readme file and enjoy.

## 1- Optimize / Compress MP3 files:
Have you ever had all your favorite music and you want to save it all in a flash, drive or even your mobile phone, but due to the limited volume of the tools, you had to delete some of them? This happened to me and I didn't want to delete a file. So, with this technique, I did not delete a file and converted 3 gigs to 1.2 gigs (the quality of my files did not change much).

## 2- Delete duplicate files
Have you ever saved so many duplicate files that they took up the entire volume of your system drives and you want to keep one of the files so that you don't have duplicate files? I wrote two functions in the script, one of which compares two different drives or folders and removes duplicates from one of them.
Another one is that it only compares the files of a folder or drive and deletes the duplicates.
both of which may be a bit time consuming if the folders are large.
